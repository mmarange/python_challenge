# Python - Py Me Up, Charlie

* This Pybank assignment folder contains the following:

  * A new file called `main.py`. This is the main script to run for each analysis.
  * A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files I used.
  * An "analysis" folder that contains your text file that has the results from my analysis.

* In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. I was given a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
